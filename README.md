# ArnoldC

Programming language based on the one-liners of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

## Motivation

Although the one-liners of Arnold Schwarzenegger are fairly well known the true semantics of the uttering is yet to be understood. This project tries to discover new meanings from the Arnold movies with the means of computer science.

## HelloWorld.arnoldc

	IT'S SHOWTIME
	TALK TO THE HAND "hello world"
	YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED

## Quick Start

	wget http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC.jar
	echo -e "IT'S SHOWTIME\nTALK TO THE HAND \"hello world\"\nYOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED" > hello.arnoldc
	java -jar ArnoldC.jar hello.arnoldc
	java hello

To create some "audible" output you can try the -declaim option:

	java -jar ArnoldC.jar -declaim hello.arnoldc
